      This tile is dedicated to my Brother Ben who is active-duty in the Air Force as an intel officer. He's being deployed to Afghanistan in October and I will be thinking about him and his family every day. He's amazingly smart and a dedicated husband and father. He might be my little brother but he's one of my heroes and role models. He is a true image of patriotism
